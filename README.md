# Excel-to-PDF-Generate
This Python script automates the generation of PDF files for each record in a Google Sheet. Each PDF contains details from a single record and is saved with a name derived from the GCP/DB/CP Name/ID field. Finally, all generated PDFs are bundled into a ZIP file for easy download.
